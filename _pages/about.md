I'm a **Biostatistician** in the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health at [Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments/environmental-public-health), working with [Damaskini Valvi](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/valvi-damaskini) and [Megan K Horton](https://www.hortonlab.org/). My primary research interest focuses on studying the impact of preconception and prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals on health outcomes during the life course. 

As a biostatistician with a focus on environmental epidemiology, I have extensive experience applying statistical methods to identify environmental risks that impact public health. My research experience includes expertise in a wide range of statistical techniques such as environmental mixture modelling, metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) and high-dimensional data analysis, among others. I am constantly exploring new statistical methods to bring new insights to the environmental epidemiology field, and I am passionate about utilizing cutting-edge statistical tools to address complex research questions. My love for coding allows me to manipulate and analyze data in an efficient and effective manner, and I am always looking for new ways to apply my skills to make meaningful contributions to public health. 

Previously I received my Bachelor of Medicine from [Xinxiang Medical University](https://www.xxmu.edu.cn/gjjlc/info/1051/1208.htm) in China. And I earned my Master of Science in Biostatistics from [Rutgers School of Public Health](https://sph.rutgers.edu/) in New Jersey under [Dirk Moore](https://sph.rutgers.edu/directory/dirk-moore-phd). Outside of work, I enjoy long-distance riding, traveling, and movies, but mostly spending quality time with my loved ones.
